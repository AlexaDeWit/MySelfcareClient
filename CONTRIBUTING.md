# Contributing

- Basically, just follow the steps in the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), up until but not including the deployment part.
- Submit a pull request with the feature you wish to add and a short description of intent for the PR.
- I'm not super particular about it, I'll read the code anyway to see what it does, after all.
- When adding issues, please try to describe as much as possible the state that application needs to be in to replicate the issue, if appropraite.
